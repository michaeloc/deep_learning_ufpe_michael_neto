# Models to generate embeddings from wikipedia's abstracts.
<p>1 - Projeto_Disciplina_2018.2_IN1164.ipynb is the main file to execute the experiment and generate the embeddings according to model chosen.</p>
<p>2 - It's necessary to create the folder "embeddings" or just alterate the file .ipynb</p>
<p>3 - In order to evaluate the quality of embeddings, we just execute the scripts read_numpy.py and model.py</p>
